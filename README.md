# Recipe-Scraper-CLI
A Data Gem that scrapes recipes from the internet and represents them to the user with a CLI

## Introduction

How many times do you get done with work for the day, realize how hungry you are, but have NO CLUE what to make for dinner? If you're anything like me, that answer is WAY TOO OFTEN! Introducing a CLI app that will scan for recipes and display them to you, cutting through that paralyzing fog of indecision! Load up the app with ruby ./bin/run.rb, and wait a few minutes for the recipes to be loaded. Users can then list every recipe with the command 'recipes', ask for a random recipe from the list with 'random', or search for recipes with a particular ingredient with 'ingredient' followed by what item you want to search for. Type 'help' to display your options, and 'exit' to close the app.
